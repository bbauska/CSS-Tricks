# CSS Preprocessors 101: Understanding Sass, SCSS, Less, and Stylus

## An Introduction to CSS Preprocessors
CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the capabilities of CSS. They might also loosely be called CSS extensions or an extension language.

They allow developers to use variables, functions, and other programming constructs in their stylesheets. This makes it easier to maintain and scale large CSS projects and also enables the use of more advanced design patterns.

The most common types of CSS preprocessors are Sass , SCSS , Less , and Stylus . Each of these preprocessors has its unique syntax and features, but they all make it easier to write and manage CSS code.

Sass, for example, uses indentation to indicate the nesting of selectors, whereas SCSS uses curly braces like CSS. On the other hand, Less uses a syntax similar to CSS but with added features like variables and mixins. Stylus is a bit different. It uses a more dynamic approach and a more flexible syntax that allows developers to write code in a way that feels more natural to them.

## Why Use CSS Preprocessors?
Before diving into the specifics of each preprocessor, it’s essential to understand the purpose of using a preprocessor in the first place.

CSS preprocessors allow developers to write more efficient and maintainable code using variables, functions, and other programming constructs.

This can make it easier to apply consistent styling throughout a website and make changes to the design more quickly and easily.

Additionally, preprocessors can be used to write more advanced CSS, such as grid frameworks, to build responsive websites with less code.

## Sass: The Most Powerful CSS Extension Language
Sass, short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets , is one of the oldest and most popular CSS preprocessors.

It was first released in 2006 and has become a widely-used tool for writing efficient and maintainable CSS code. Sass uses indentation to indicate selectors’ nesting, making it easy to read and understand.

The syntax is similar to that of CSS but with added features like variables and mixins.

## Variables – The First Superpower from Sass
One of the most valuable features of Sass is the ability to use variables. This allows developers to define a value once and reuse it throughout the stylesheet, making it easy to update and maintain the design.

Here’s what it would look like if we defined a variable for your site’s primary color and then used it for both the H1 heading and a button class.

``
$primary-color: #0078d7

h1
  color: $primary-color

.btn
  background-color: $primary-color
  color: white
  ```

## Mathematical Operations are Supported Too
Sass also supports mathematical operations, allowing developers to quickly perform calculations and create complex layouts.

This is particularly useful for grid layouts, enabling you to evenly divide elements without performing the calculations yourself.

For example:

```
$grid-columns: 12
$gutter-width: 20px

.grid-item
  width: 100% / $grid-columns
  padding: 0 ($gutter-width / 2)
```

## Sass Provides Native Functions
In addition, Sass has built-in functions that are extremely useful for various common scenarios.

There are functions for manipulating lists, strings, and more complex math functions.

The most commonly used functions are darken() and lighten(). These generate color variations, which can be helpful when creating a color palette.

Examples of color functions:

```
.card
  background-color: $primary-color

  &:hover    
    background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%)
```

## Mixins to Reduce Repeating Code
Sass also has mixins , reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple selectors.

This allows developers to avoid repeating code and make changes to the design more quickly and easily. The use of mixins can also help make the code more modular and easy to understand.

For example, you could define a border-radius mixin that will apply the same value to all browser/vendor prefixes :

```
@mixin border-radius($radius:5px)
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius
  -moz-border-radius: $radius
  border-radius: $radius

.btn
  @include border-radius

.card    
  @include border-radius(10px)
```

In this example, if you don’t pass a value to the mixin, it will use the default value of 5px. That’s why .btn doesn’t need to pass a value.

<breakpoint>
Note: Vendor Prefixes were required on many CSS properties when first introduced, but that requirement has gradually disappeared. You no longer need this particular mixin for border-radius! Here is one site which tracks which properties still require prefixes .
<breakpoint>

Mixins can also accept multiple arguments, and you can easily use them to create complex styles. Mixins are a potent tool in Sass and can help you to write more maintainable and efficient CSS code.

A Common Complaint: Unnecessary Complexity
One of the main criticisms of Sass is that it can make the code more complex, especially for developers unfamiliar with the syntax.

Sass, as a preprocessor, uses a different syntax than standard CSS, which can be confusing for developers unfamiliar with it. The indentation-based syntax of Sass can be particularly challenging for developers who are used to the curly-braces-based syntax of CSS.

This can make it difficult for them to read and understand the code, especially when working on large projects with many nested selectors.

Another reason why Sass can make the code more complex is the use of advanced features like variables, functions, and mixins. For example, variables can make it difficult to trace where a value is being used and how it’s being modified throughout the stylesheet.

However, it’s important to note that the complexity of Sass is not inherent to the language itself but rather how it’s being used. Sass is a powerful tool, but it’s not always necessary to use its advanced features for every project.

In fact, it’s probably better to stick with plain CSS for small or simple projects. But, for large and complex projects, Sass can be a great asset to make the code more maintainable, readable and efficient.

It’s all about understanding the trade-offs and using Sass judiciously. With proper documentation, consistent conventions and a clear codebase, developers can use Sass without adding complexity to the code.

## SCSS: A New Syntax for Sass

SCSS, which stands for Sassy CSS , is just a variant of Sass’s syntax.

SCSS was introduced as an alternative syntax to the original Sass indentation-based syntax to make it more approachable for developers unfamiliar with Sass.

SCSS is a superset of CSS, meaning that any valid CSS code is also valid SCSS code. It uses curly braces and semi-colons like CSS, making it more familiar and easier for developers already familiar with CSS. Sass syntax is a little different; it uses indentation to indicate the nesting of selectors.

SCSS has all the features of Sass, like variables, mixins, and functions, but it also supports CSS’s syntax. This makes it easy to convert an existing CSS file to SCSS.

You can write plain CSS code in an SCSS file, which will work the same way.
